## Getting started with a website

So I wanted to get a website to write about my work and IT related topics.<br> 
I am very passionate about IT and I think I need an outlet to share this passion with others. Allthough I'm not a great writer (especially if I'm writing in english), I think there may be useful stuff I can share with my peers or, at the very least, keep as reminder from where I've started and what I've learned... <br>
Welcome, dear reader! I appreciate you! ❤️
